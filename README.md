# More-Honey Final Project Details

Hello! Welcome to our INFO 201 final project! In this application, we will be looking at honey production data from **1998 to 2012**. This data was obtained from [kaggle.com](kaggle.com), and was read in by *CSV*.

Please note that you will have to install the dev version of Plotly for one of our plots to work. You can install it by running this line: `install.packages(devtools::install_github("ropensci/plotly"))`

Here is a link to our final project:
